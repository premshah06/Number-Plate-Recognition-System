## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes images and extracts license plate numbers within ~2 seconds.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves ~90% detection accuracy under various conditions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Scalable Data Logging**: Tracks and updates vehicle violation records.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Enables data-driven decision-making to improve traffic management systems.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Optical Character Recognition**: Tesseract OCR
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
- **Visualization**: Streamlit, Matplotlib
- **Data Storage**: Excel/Spreadsheet Integration

---

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload images through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Image Processing**: The system uses OpenCV for contour detection, edge detection, and grayscale filtering to identify the license plate.
3. **Text Extraction**: Tesseract OCR converts the detected plate into text.
4. **Data Logging**: Violation records are updated and stored in an Excel file for future reference.
5. **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays the detected license plate text and logs the number of violations.
